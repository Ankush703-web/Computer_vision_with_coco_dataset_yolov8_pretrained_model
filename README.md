#  🎥 YOLOv8 Object Detection with COCO Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to perform object detection using the powerful **YOLOv8** model on the **COCO dataset**. It walks through the full workflow from loading a pretrained model and training, to evaluating performance and exporting for deployment.

> ✅ Ideal for those looking to explore cutting-edge object detection using YOLOv8 in a hands-on way.

## 📚 About YOLOv8

**YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, v8)** is the latest generation of real-time object detection models developed by [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics). It is:

- 🔥 Faster and more accurate than its predecessors  
- 🧩 Modular: supports classification, detection, segmentation, and pose estimation  
- 💻 Pythonic: clean, intuitive API powered by PyTorch  
- 🧠 Trainable on custom or built-in datasets

## 🖼️ YOLOv8 Architecture (Conceptual)

Input Image
↓
Backbone (CSPDarknet + C2f Modules)
↓
Neck (FPN + PAN for feature fusion)
↓
Head (Detect layers with anchor-free prediction)
↓
Bounding Boxes + Class Probabilities


YOLOv8 uses anchor-free detection and efficient tensor operations to enable fast, real-time detection with competitive accuracy.

## 📦 About the COCO Dataset

**COCO (Common Objects in Context)** is a widely-used dataset for training and benchmarking vision models. It features:

- 📸 200K+ images  
- 🏷️ 80 object categories  
- 🧍‍♂️ Real-world, complex scenes with multiple objects  

In this notebook, we use **COCO128**, a lightweight subset with 128 images, ideal for quick training and testing.

## ✅ What This Project Demonstrates

This notebook walks through the full object detection pipeline:

### 1. Model Loading
- Loads YOLOv8 pretrained weights (e.g., `yolov8n.pt`).

### 2. Training
- Fine-tunes the model on the `coco128.yaml` configuration.
- Uses default settings for quick experimentation.

### 3. Validation
- Evaluates model performance using metrics like precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP).

### 4. Inference
- Runs predictions on sample images and visualizes the results.

### 5. Export
- Converts the trained model to formats like ONNX, TorchScript, CoreML for deployment.
